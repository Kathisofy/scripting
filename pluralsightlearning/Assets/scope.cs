	 * it seperates ideas.  you can access variables outside of the areas by making variables public.
	 * it also allows you to change things on the variable without having to mess with the code.
	 * you can also access them from other scripts so you dont have to write it over and over again.
	 * we used this in the array lesson.
	 * classes without specifically being called public will automatically be private.
